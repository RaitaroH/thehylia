# thehylia.py

`thehylia.py` is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) interface for getting [The Hylia](http://anime.thehylia.com/soundtracks/) soundtracks. It makes thehylia mass downloads a breeze. It's easy to use - check it!

From command line:

```cmd
thehylia.py yakitate-japan-original-soundtrack
```

As an import:

```python
import thehylia
thehylia.download('yakitate-japan-original-soundtrack')
# And bam, you've got the Yakitate!! Japan soundtrack!
```

For video game music, [check out `khinsider.py`](https://github.com/obskyr/khinsider).

## Usage

Just run `thehylia.py` from the command line with the sole parameter being the soundtrack you want to download. Easy!

If you want, you can also add another parameter as the output folder, but that's optional.

If you don't want to go to the actual site to look for soundtracks, you can also just type a search term as the first parameter(s), and provided it's not a valid soundtrack, `thehylia.py` will give you a list of soundtracks matching that term.

You're going to need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (2 or 3 - `thehylia.py` works with both), so install that (and [add it to your path](http://superuser.com/a/143121)) if you haven't already.

You will also need to have [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed (download `get-pip.py` and run it) if you don't already have [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) and [Beautiful Soup 4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4). The first time `thehylia.py` runs, it will install these two for you.

## As a module

`thehylia.py` requires two non-standard modules: [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) and [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4). Just run a `pip install` on them (with [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)), or just run `thehylia.py` on its own once and it'll install them for you.

Here are the functions you will be using:

### `thehylia.download(soundtrackName[, path="", verbose=False])`

Download the soundtrack `soundtrackName`. This should be the name the soundtrack uses at the end of its album URL.

If `path` is specified, the soundtrack files will be downloaded to that path. If `verbose` is `True`, it will print progress as it is downloading.

### `thehylia.search(term)`

Search The Hylia for `term`. Return a list of soundtrack IDs matching the search term.

# Is this `khinsider.py` except it's for The Hylia?

Yes. Yes, it is.

The creators of the sites were nice enough to use a very, very similar site structure, which made a The Hylia script not only very possible, but very easy (or, uh, it should've been, had I not gone all metaprogramming-y on it). It would absolutely be possible to have both in the same script, with an argument for which site to check / download from, but I feel the separation of them as two scripts is logical and easier to handle.
